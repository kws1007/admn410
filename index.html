</b>

<p> <h4>Unimpressed with the low quality products offered at larger chain pet stores,
Jimmy Jenkins founded Durham House of Pets in 1999. 
In DHP’s early days, Jimmy Jenkins would make his own pet food 
and dog biscuits. Durham House of Pets grew in popularity and word 
spread about his natural pet foods.</h4>

<p> <h2><u>Why Use Us?</u></h2>

<p> <h4>Durham House of Pets specializes in Organic pet food. 
Jimmy wanted his customers' pets to eat just as well as humans do. 
Jimmy also places high priority on quality customer service. 
Everyone who works at DHP is carefully chosen for their love of animals. 
The employees are trained extensively to answer every customer question with confidence. 
DHP still produces it’s own organic premium pet foods, 
but they also source food from other organic manufacturers that meet DHP’s high standards.
Durham House of Pets is located in the heart of Durham, New Hampshire. </h4>
